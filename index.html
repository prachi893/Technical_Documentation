  <section class="main-section" id="introduction"> <header> Introduction to  C++</header> <p> C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa </section>

  <p> C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:

C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.</p>

<p>C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.</p>

<p>C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.</p>

C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.

<p>C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.</p>

<p>There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.</p></section>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <section class="main-section" id="modules" > <header> Modules  </header>
     <p> C++20 introduces modules, a modern solution for componentization of C++ libraries and programs. A module is a set of source code files that are compiled independently of the translation units that import them. Modules eliminate or greatly reduce many of the problems associated with the use of header files, and also potentially reduce compilation times. Macros, preprocessor directives, and non-exported names declared in a module are not visible and therefore have no effect on the compilation of the translation unit that imports the module. You can import modules in any order without concern for macro redefinitions. Declarations in the importing translation unit do not participate in overload resolution or name lookup in the imported module. After a module is compiled once, the results are stored in a binary file that describes all the exported types, functions and templates. That file can be processed much faster than a header file, and can be reused by the compiler every place where the module is imported in a project.
     </p>
      <p>Modules can be used side by side with header files. A C++ source file can import modules and also #include header files. In some cases, a header file can be imported as a module rather than textually #included by the preprocessor. We recommend that new projects use modules rather than header files as much as possible. For larger existing projects under active development, we suggest that you experiment with converting legacy headers to modules to see whether you get a meaningful reduction in compilation times.
     </p>
	 
	 
	 
	 <h2>Enable modules in the Microsoft C++ compiler</h2>
<p>As of Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2, modules are not fully implemented in the Microsoft C++ compiler. You can use the modules feature to create single-partition modules and to import the Standard Library modules provided by Microsoft. To enable support for modules, compile with /experimental:module and /std:c++latest. In a Visual Studio project, right-click the project node in Solution Explorer and choose Properties. Set the Configuration drop-down to All Configurations, then choose Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Language > Enable C++ Modules (experimental).

A module and the code that consumes it must be compiled with the same compiler options.</p>

<h2>Consume the C++ Standard Library as modules</h2>
<p>Although not specified by the C++20 standard, Microsoft enables its implementation of the C++ Standard Library to be imported as modules. By importing the C++ Standard Library as modules rather than #including it through header files, you can potentially speed up compilation times depending on the size of your project. The library is componentized into the following modules:</p>

<p>std.regex provides the content of header <regex></p>
<p>std.filesystem provides the content of header <filesystem></p>
<p>std.memory provides the content of header <memory></p>
<p>std.threading provides the contents of headers <atomic>, <condition_variable>, <future>, <mutex>, <shared_mutex>, and <thread></p>
<p>std.core provides everything else in the C++ Standard Library</p>
To consume these modules, just add an import declaration to the top of the source code file. For example:

C++

Copy
<div>
<code>
import std.core;<br>
import std.regex;
</code>
</div>
To consume the Microsoft Standard Library module, compile your program with /EHsc and /MD options.

<h2>Basic example</h2>
<pre>
C++

Copy
<code>
export module Foo;

#define ANSWER 42

namespace Bar
{
   int f_internal() {
        return ANSWER;
      }

   export int f() {
      return f_internal();
   }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>The file MyProgram.cpp uses the import declaration to access the name that is exported by Foo. Note that the name Bar is visible here, but not all of its members. Also note that the macro ANSWER is not visible.
</p>
<pre>
C++

Copy
<code>
import Foo;
import std.core;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   cout << "The result of f() is " << Bar::f() << endl; // 42
   // int i = Bar::f_internal(); // C2039
   // int j = ANSWER; //C2065
}
</code>

The import declaration can appear only at global scope.

<h3>C++ program to print right angled (Right oriented) pyramid of numbers</h3>


<p>In this program, we are going to learn how to print numbered pyramids of numbers (which is right angled and right oriented)? This post contains solved program with output and explanation.</p>
<p>

C++ program to print Right oriented right angled pyramid

Here, we are going to implement following pattern:</p>
<pre>
<code>
       1
    2  3
  4 5  6
7 8 9 10
</code>
Consider the program:

ï»¿
<code>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

	int i, space, rows, k=1;

	cout<<"Enter the number of rows: ";
	cin>>rows;
	
	for(i=1; i<=rows; i++) {
		for(space=i; space<rows; space++) {
			cout<<"\t";
		}
		for(j=1; j<=i; j++) {
			cout<<k<<"\t";
			k++;
		}
		cout<<"\n";
	}

	return 0;
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>We take the number of rows as the limit in the loop. The outer loop is for taking care of rows and the inner loop will take of the columns. In this program we need to take care of the space, as it is important, otherwise pyramid won't form correctly.
</p><p>
Here we initialize the value of space to i, since the number of iterations keep decreasing with the increment of i and that is what we need with successive iterations. Next we run the inner loop upto ith row, since, number of elements in the row is equal to the ith value. In that loop we print the value of k and finally, increment the k for the next iteration. For printing on next row, we print the next line in the end statement of outer loop.
